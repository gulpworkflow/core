# Gulp Workflow
_Gulp Workflow is a toolset for designers and front-end coders to deliver their projects at blazing speeds.  At its 'core' the workflow is series of gulp tasks, helper functions, and configurations that allow you to build your projects.  The workflow itself is un-opionated and is compatible with virtually any web-based system.  To help you get started, we have a series of starters for WordPress, static sites, Jeykll, and Email templates._

_Gulp Workflow is designed to help you the following things:_
  
##### 1) Organize your source code
##### 2) Automate the build process
##### 3) Optimize + bundle your project for deployment

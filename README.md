# Gulp Build Workflow
*This is a workflow for delivering coded UI with traditional (html/vanilla js/css) or modern tools (scss/es6/jade/twig/nunjucks).* 
  
*It supports production-ready delivery (favicon generator, image minification, asset revisioning).*

*With this resource, you can deliver a static site, prototype interfaces with real code/data, or build out assets & templates as themes for another system (such as WordPress)*

# Gulp Workflow
_Gulp Workflow is a toolset for designers and front-end coders to deliver their projects at blazing speeds.  This workflow is centralized set of gulp tasks, helper functions, and configurations that allow you to work more consistently & quickly.  The workflow itself is highly configurable & un-opionated and, therefore compatible with virtually any web-based system!  To help you get started, we have a series of starters for WordPress, static sites, Jeykll, and Email templates._

_Gulp Workflow is designed to help you the following things:_
  
##### 1) Organize your source code
##### 2) Automate the build process
##### 3) Optimize + bundle your project for deployment
